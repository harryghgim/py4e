# py4e

## Welcome to my py4e repository ðŸ‘‹

Here I compiled all codes from [Python for Everyone course](https://www.py4e.com/) by [Charles Severance](https://github.com/csev) and [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python) challenge by freeCodeCamp. All codes are either written by me or were provided as starters in challenges.

In `exercises` directory you can see all of the codes I wrote in *Python for Everyone course*. And in `projects` directory you can also see codes that I wrote for five projects in Scientific Computing with Python by freeCodeCamp.

*Happy coding!*
